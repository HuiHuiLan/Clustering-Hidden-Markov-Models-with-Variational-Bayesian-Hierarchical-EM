function [ent, nll] = vbhmm_entropy(hmm, data)
% vbhmm_entropy - compute approximation to the entropy of an HMM
%
% Entropy is a measure of certainty/uncertainty. Higher values means more uncertain or random, 
% while Entropy of 0 means completely deterministic.
%
%   [ent, nll] = vbhmm_entropy(hmm, data)
%
% INPUTS
%   hmm = HBMM learned with vbhmm_learn
%  data = cell array of fixation sequences (as in vbhmm_learn) used to train hmm
%
% OUTPUTS
%   ent = the approximate entropy of the HMM. 
%   nll  = negative log-likelihood of data using HMM.
