function [loglik, errors] = vbhmm_ll(hmm, data, opt)
% vbhmm_ll - compute the log-likelihood of sequences under an HMM
%
%  [loglik, errors] = vbhmm_ll(hmm, data, opt)
%
% INPUTS
%   hmm = HMM learned with vbhmm_learn
%   data = cell array of fixation sequences (as in data passed to vbhmm_learn)
%   opt = 'n' - normalize log-likelihood of each sequence by the length of the sequence (default) --
%               longer sequences typically have lower log-likelihoods (log-likelihood for each
%               fixation is negative, and they add). Normalization will make log-likelihoods
%               of different-length sequences more comparable.
%          '' - no normalization
%
% OUTPUTS
%   loglik = log-likelihoods of each sequence [1 x N]
%   errors = whether errors occurred for each sequence [1 x N]

% 2017-05-17: BUG FIX - Sequence normalization was wrong for length-1 sequences.
%                       The old code erroneously thought these were length-2 sequences.
%                       This should only affect comparison of log-likelihoods (for correlation tests).
